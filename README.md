1. Read the helpful instructions for adding a secret. 
    1. Replace the token in the last line of the code with the secret.
2.  Run the code. It takes a while to install everything. Once done you should see the message from line 12

    1. Any errors? I hope not. If there are errors let your Teacher or TA know. Be explicit about the error. Look at the console and look at the last error, line number, and the message.
